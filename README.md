## Branding Basics

A quick primer on the branding, pending a full write up

### Type

Text makes use of 2 typefaces:

 - [PT Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono?selection.family=PT+Mono)
 - Lato

Lato is used for body text on the website, but PT Mono is used for headings, titles, and taglines. The main WordCamp logo should always be set in PT Mono. Both can be acquired and downloaded via Google Fonts for local use. PT Mono has a single font weight, and should never be used in bold or italicised.

### Colour and Emphasising Text

The following colours are used for text:

 - #ad4c23 primary logo text and title
 - #604b43 secondary text and headings
 - #eea548 the logo colour, use for emphasis instead of bold, and calls to action
 
### Backgrounds

Try to make use of the hexagon regular pattern in the hexagon subfolder, or a blank white background if not possible. Try to line up either the horizontal bars or a diagonal with the main logos hexagon in any artwork produced.

In some cases, a separate background might be necessary. An example of this is the website, which uses the above for the header, but has a solid background colour below the menu. In this case, use the colour #f6efef.
